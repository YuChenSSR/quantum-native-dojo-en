    "### What is dynamics simulation?\n",
    "One of the most important applications of computers, whether classical or quantum, is \"**simulation of the dynamics of physical systems**\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation of physical systems is an indispensable technology that makes life around us possible. For example, computer simulations of physical systems, such as building and aircraft design, weather forecasting, and drug discovery, are frequently used. The goal of simulating a physical system is to know what the system will be like after a certain amount of time, given the **initial state** (initial state) of the system (the object of interest) and the rules of **dynamics = time evolution** (how the system changes over time) of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider, for example, a billiard simulation. The initial state is the initial position and velocity of each ball. Also, since this is a classical dynamical system, the time evolution rules are Newton's equations of motion (differential equations). Given these, we can predict where each ball will be at the end of the break shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the example above, the rules of time evolution of a system are generally expressed by **differential equations**. Newton's equations of motion for classical dynamical systems, Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic systems, Navier-Stokes equations for hydrodynamic systems, and so on. Therefore, the essence of simulation of physical systems comes down to numerically solving differential equations. And, of course, this is also the case with simulation of quantum systems, i.e., systems obeying quantum mechanics ."

    "### simulation of quantum systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum systems evolve in time according to something called the Schrodinger equation (see below). Therefore, to simulate the dynamics of a quantum system, it is necessary to solve the Schrodinger equation numerically. As in the simulation of other physical systems, it is possible in principle to simulate quantum systems using a classical computer. In fact, by skillful use of various approximations, simulations of quantum systems using classical computers have achieved a certain degree of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **when simulating quantum systems with a classical computer, it soon becomes impossible to compete because the computational time increases exponentially as the size of the system (number of particles and spins) increases.** For example, to simulate a system with $n$ qubits, approximately $2^n$ equations must be solved (see: Nielsen-Chuang `4.7 Simulation of quantum systems`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea was then born to **solve the above problem by simulating quantum systems using a quantum computer, which is expected to increase in speed exponentially.** It is truly a \"quantum problem solved by quantum\".\n",

    "In this chapter, we will learn about typical methods of simulating the dynamics of quantum systems using quantum computers."

    "Hamiltonian is the operator in the Schrodinger equation that governs the time evolution of the system. When you make a simulation by a quantum computer, you can think of it as just a large matrix. The difference from the quantum operations we learned in Chapter 1 is that the Hamiltonian is Hermitian $H=H^\\dagger$. Therefore, in general, it is not possible to create a state $H|\\psi\\rangle$ with the Hamiltonian acting on it on a quantum computer. (The exception is the Pauli operator $X,Y,Z$, which is unitary and Hermitian.)\n",

The Hamiltonian contains all of the information about the system, such as the forces between particles and external forces (electric and magnetic fields, etc.). By putting this Hamiltonian into the Schrodinger equation and solving it, we obtain a value for the energy of the system."

    "Solving the Schrodinger equation under a given Hamiltonian generally yields multiple solutions (pairs of states and energies). Of these, the state with the lowest energy, i.e., the most stable, is called the \"**ground state**\" and is the easiest to be realized in nature (as the temperature of the system increases, higher energy states are also more likely to appear).\n",
